%% Final project question 4
% T(x,y)=(T_2-T_1)*w(x,y)+T_1
% w(x,y,number of terms)=(2/pi)*sum_odd(2/n sin(n*pi*x/L)(sinh(n*pi*y/L))/(sinh(n*pi*W/L)))

%known values
T_1=70 %deg F
T_2=200 %deg F
L=2 %feet
W=2 feet

%% part a
% verify the terms of w become smaller as n increases; use x=y=1
n=-1
while error>.1
  n=n+2
  Wnew=w(1,1,n)
  error=Wnew-Wold/Wold
  Wold=Wnew
  
end

%% part b
% using x=y=1 find the number of terms of w needed to provide a tempature calcualtion that is within 1%
% as in for what value of n will the addition of the next term in the series produce a change in T of less than 1%


%% part c
% using part b compute the temperatures in the whole plate with a spacing of .2 ft for x and y
% for loop for x and y while loop for T
% possibly store n for each x,y in another page
